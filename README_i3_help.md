## 🔍 Advanced Search Techniques

### **Conceptual Search**
Instead of remembering exact key combinations, search by what you want to do:
- `"take screenshot"` → finds Print key bindings
- `"control volume"` → finds audio controls
- `"open terminal"` → finds Warp Terminal launcher
- `"switch workspace"` → finds workspace navigation
- `"make window bigger"` → finds resize controls

### **Application-Specific Terms**
The system knows about your specific applications:
- `"warp"` → Warp Terminal bindings
- `"brave"` → Brave browser launcher
- `"thunar"` → File manager bindings
- `"pavucontrol"` → Audio control panel
- `"blueman"` → Bluetooth manager

### **Smart Corrections**
Common typos are automatically fixed:
- `"sceenshot"` → `"screenshot"`
- `"volme"` → `"volume"`
- `"broswer"` → `"browser"`
- `"teminal"` → `"terminal"`
- `"workspce"` → `"workspace"`

---

## 🛠️ Customization

### **Adding Custom Search Terms**
Edit `scripts/search_dictionaries.json` to add your own terms:

```json
{
  "synonyms": {
    "your_app": ["alternative_name", "nickname", "shortcut"]
  },
  "intents": {
    "do_something": ["command_pattern", "app_name", "script_name"]
  },
  "typos": {
    "commom_typo": "correct_spelling"
  }
}
```

### **Launcher Compatibility**
The system works with multiple launchers:
- **rofi** (preferred): Best visual experience with themes and icons
- **dmenu**: Fallback option, works everywhere
- **fzf**: Terminal-based option for minimalist setups

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Help System Doesn't Start**
- Check file permissions: `chmod +x ~/.config/i3/scripts/i3-help.py`
- Verify Python 3 installation: `python3 --version`
- Test script directly: `python3 ~/.config/i3/scripts/i3-help.py`

### **No Launcher Found**
- Install rofi: `sudo apt install rofi` (preferred)
- Or install dmenu: `sudo apt install dmenu` (fallback)

### **Empty Search Results**
- Check i3 config exists: `ls ~/.config/i3/config`
- Verify config syntax: `i3-msg -t get_config`
- Test search dictionaries: `cat ~/.config/i3/scripts/search_dictionaries.json`

### **Export Functionality Issues**
- For PDF export: `pip install weasyprint`
- Check output directory permissions
- Ensure Documents folder exists or export will use home directory

### **Restore Original Help System**
If you need to revert to the original help system:
```bash
cd ~/.config/i3/scripts
cp i3_help.py.backup i3_help.py
cp i3_help_topics.yaml.backup i3_help_topics.yaml
```
